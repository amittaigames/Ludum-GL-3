# Ludum GL 3

### Main Goal

The main goal of Ludum GL 3 is to provide an easy to use, light-weight game engine, good enough for new or advanced developers.
The engine is written to have full control of all aspects of the game: graphics, audio, and input. Eventually there could
be physics support, and other elements that some people might not want to write themselves.

### Dependencies

* LWJGL
* LWJGL Util
* Slick Util

LWJGL natives are included with the game engine, will be extracted upon first run, and loaded every time.
