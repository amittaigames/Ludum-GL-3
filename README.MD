# Ludum GL 3

### Main Goal

The main goal of Ludum GL 3 is to provide an easy to use, light-weight game engine, good enough for new or advanced developers.
The engine is written to have full control of all aspects of the game: graphics, audio, and input. Eventually there could
be physics support, and other elements that some people might not want to write themselves.

### Dependencies

* LWJGL 		(lwjgl.jar)
* LWJGL Util	(lwjgl_util.jar)
* LWJGL Test	(lwjgl_test.jar)
* Slick Util	(slick-util.jar)

LWJGL natives are included with the game engine, will be extracted upon first run, and loaded every time.
The version of LWJGL that is used is **2.9.3**
